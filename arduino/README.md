# Arduino-as-GPIO Firmware

this is the firmware part of Arduino-as-GPIO. It is written in C++ and uses the Arduino framework.


## Building

open the `arduino.ino` file in the Arduino IDE and upload it to your Arduino.
optionally you can change the `COMM_BAUD_RATE` constant in the `arduino.ino` file to change the baud rate of the serial connection.

if you don't know how to upload a sketch to your Arduino, please refer to the [Arduino documentation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage).
